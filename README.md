# video

This repository holds a bunch of command line scripts I use to manipulate
videos. They are wrappers around ffmpeg to make repetitive tasks easier.

## ⚠ Worl in progress ⚠

This is a high work in progress. I add, remove and edit scripts, so don't expect
any clear API for now. I also may add scripts tailored to a specific need of
mine that might not be relevant to you.

## Dependencies

It requires `ffmpeg` to be available in your path. Note that if you're using
Ubuntu you'll need to compile ffmpeg yourself as the version available through
`apt-get` is a non-compatible fork.
